# Yellowbrick
Yellowbrick is a Los Angeles based financial planning company specializing in life insurance, retirement planning, and investment advice. Due to the proprietary nature of the code only selected, approved snippets of my code can be shared in this repository. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and ReactJS code.

My responsibility at Yellowbrick was to create a seamless user experience that allowed financial agents to access and manage client data in the database. I headed a team of ~10 people in charge of integrating their code into a unified client intake form. This form allowed agents to input a new client's personal information (e.g. name, address, income information, insurance plans). I also created a client view page givng agents quick access to single client's information and allowing them to edit information as needed. Admins of the application could also invite new agents through email and permit those agents to create an account on the site.
